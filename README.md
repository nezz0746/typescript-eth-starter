# Get Started

Clone the project and install dependencies,

```
git clone https://github.com/nezz0746/typescript-eth-starter.git
cd eth-starter
yarn install
```

Then open 3 separate terminals and run

1. Start your local node

```
yarn chain
```

2. Deploy your Greeter contract to your local node with

```
yarn deploy
```

3. Then start your frontend !

```
yarn dev
```

Finnally, open <http://localhost:3000> to see the app.

You frontend should be live on localhost and ready to submit and new `setGreeting` transaction to the local chain !
